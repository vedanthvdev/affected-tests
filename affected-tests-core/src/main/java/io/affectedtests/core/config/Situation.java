 * One of the named decision branches the engine can end up on. Every engine

 * {@link Action} via the per-situation config in
 * {@link AffectedTestsConfig}.
 *
 * <p>The seven situations are deliberately exhaustive and mutually exclusive,
 * so a human reading the {@code --explain} output never has to reconstruct
 * which of several overlapping "safety net" branches the engine actually
 * took. The priority in {@link io.affectedtests.core.AffectedTestsEngine}
 * evaluates them in a fixed order — empty diff, all-ignored,
 * all-out-of-scope, unmapped, discovery-incomplete, discovery-empty,
 * discovery-success — so any diff maps to a single situation even when it
 * nominally touches several buckets.
 *
 * <p>Note: {@link io.affectedtests.core.mapping.PathToClassMapper} already
 * routes a file to at most one of its buckets (ignore, out-of-scope,
 * production, test, unmapped) by evaluating the same rules in the same
 * order, so the "all X" situations and {@link #UNMAPPED_FILE} are by
 * construction non-overlapping — there is no diff that is simultaneously
 * "all ignored" and "contains an unmapped file".

     * {@code JavaParsers.parseOrWarn} and silently drops out of usage /
     * transitive discovery. Before v1.9.22 the only surfacing was a WARN
     * at parse time; the engine still routed through {@code DISCOVERY_EMPTY}
     * or {@code DISCOVERY_SUCCESS}, and a caller grepping the
     * {@code Situation} could not tell "nothing matched" from "matching
     * failed because we couldn't read half the files". That asymmetry is
     * especially dangerous on merge-gate runs: the caller is optimising
     * test runtime, the parse failure silently under-selects, and the
     * lost coverage only shows up on main.
     *
     * <p>Defaults in the {@link AffectedTestsConfig} resolver are
     * conservative on purpose: {@link Mode#CI} and {@link Mode#STRICT}
     * escalate to {@link Action#FULL_SUITE}, {@link Mode#LOCAL} stays on
     * {@link Action#SELECTED} (dev sees the WARN and decides). Callers
     * can override per-situation via {@code onDiscoveryIncomplete}.
